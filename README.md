# Algory
Algory is just another stackoverflow clone where you can ask a question, answer a question, downvote or upvote a question, follow or unfollow users, edit profiles, change passwords and usernames, and you can even delete your account in settings!

This is just another personal project because I want to try PocketBase and the latest version of Sveltekit, so I made this website.
